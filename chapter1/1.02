Problem:

(5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + (4 / 5))))) / (3 * (6 - 2) * (2 - 7))


How i would work it out:

(5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - 6.8))) / (3 * 4 * -5)

= (5 + 4 + (2 - -3.8)) / -60

= (5 + 4 + (2 + 3.8)) / -60

= (5 + 4 + 5.8) / -60

= 14.8 / -60

Translated into scheme:

I will take the most inner calculations first and check them as i go.

(6 + (4 / 5) becomes (+ 6 (/ 4 5)) which produces 6.8
(3 * (6 - 2) * (2 - 7) becomes (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)) which produces -60

(3 - (6 + (4 / 5))) becomes (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))) which produces -3.8

(2 - (3 - (6 + (4 / 5)))) becomes (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5)))) which produces 5.8

(5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + (4 / 5))))) becomes (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) which produces 14.8

putting it all together:

(5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + (4 / 5))))) / (3 * (6 - 2) * (2 - 7))
becomes
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5))))) (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
which produces
-0.246666 recurring


I just noticed that the big division becomes the most significant part of the expression and the two halves become the two operands.
